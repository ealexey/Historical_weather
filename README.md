# Historical_weather

For the term project I choose 3 historical data sets for the US zip 43212 (Columbus, Ohio).  The first data set  I downloaded  from                                               https://www.worldweatheronline.com/ (in csv format). The data contains historical weather data from 07/01/2008 to 10/25/2020 in hourly basis. I selected only data for noon for each day. Next, historical weather data from 09/30/2011 to 09/29/2014 were extracted. The dataset was split on three parts
1.	09/30/2011-09/29/2012
2.	09/30/2012-09/29/2013
3.	09/30/2013-09/29/2014
The second dataset  I downloaded from https://openweathermap.org/ again in csv format, because nowadays all historical weather data are present only in the csv or json format I created the html format from the csv file. The html file contains historical weather data from 09/29/2014 to 09/29/2017. The dataset was split on three parts
1.	09/30/2014-09/29/2015
2.	09/30/2015-09/29/2016
3.	09/30/2016-09/29/2017
The third data set  I downloaded from  https://www.visualcrossing.com API
1.	API key:NCG9V4G5X7Y1HN3S5U2PAWNNR The data contains historical weather data from 09/29/2017 to 09/29/2020. The dataset was split on three parts
2.	09/30/2019-09/29/2020
3.	09/30/2018-09/29/2019
4.	09/30/2017-09/29/2018

The whole idea of this project is to compare temperature for 9 consecutive periods.
